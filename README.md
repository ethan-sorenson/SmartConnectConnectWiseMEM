## Troubleshooting

**Web Service isn't available after publishing**

- Make sure the service is published as outlined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-publish-web-service "documentation").
- Make sure the service is named as expected ex. /ODataV4/Company('Sample')/MEMSalesHeader

**Something else isn't working properly**

- Use github's issue reporter on the right
- Send me an email ethan.sorenson@eonesolutions.com (might take a few days)

## Updates

- 1.0.0.3 first release on BC v17

***Enjoy!***
